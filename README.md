Brief Overview

The dataset was gotten from Kaggle. It consists of 10000 rows and 18 columns of data. In this project I performed an exploratory data analysis on a bank customers data to gain insights on some of the primary factors that cause customers to leave i.e customers churn

Objectives

This Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) aims to explore possible factors that may lead to bank customers leaving. In this context, “churn” refers to customers who have made the decision to close their accounts or stop using the bank’s services

NB: This analysis was carried out using Python.

Questions & Hypothesis

1. Does different card type have an influence on churned rates?
   
   Hypothesis: Yes, as typically banks tend to offer better products and services for those in a higher tier

2. Is the churned rates higher with lower tier cards?
   
   Hypothesis: Yes, it would make sense for banks to maintain their higher tier card members but not by a huge margin

3. Poor complaints handling can leave to higher churned rates, is that the case in this data set?
   
   Hypothesis: Yes, rationally if a customer is not happy with their services, they would transfer over to another bank that best satisfies their needs.

4. Do bank customers develop a higher churn rate on the long run with the bank?
   
   Hypothesis: No, if a bank customer is satisfied with their services they would continue banking at their current bank.

Findings:

1. Does different card type have an influence on churned rates? From the analysis, there tends to be a higher percentage of churned within the diamond card type
2. Is the churned rates higher with lower tier cards? No, the churned rates was higher with diamond card type
3. Poor complaints handling can lead to higher churned rates, is that the case in this data set?
From the analysis, diamond card type had the highest amount of complaints as well as the highest percentage of churned
4. Do bank customers have a higher churned rate the longer they are in the bank? From the analysis, bank customers churned at the highest percentage within the first year
   
Recommendations for the Bank:

1. Improve Customer Satisfaction: Conduct regular customer satisfaction surveys to identify pain points and areas for improvement. Addressing customer concerns promptly and effectively can help reduce churn rates.
2. Enhance Customer Retention Programs: Develop loyalty programs, personalized offers, and rewards to incentivize customers to stay with the bank. Building strong relationships and providing value-added services can increase customer loyalty.
3. Focus on Retaining Female Customers: Analyze the reasons behind the higher churn rate among female customers. Tailor marketing and customer service strategies to meet their
specific needs and preferences.
4. Strengthen Communication Channels: Ensure effective communication channels are in place to keep customers informed about new products, services, and updates. Regularly engage with customers through personalized interactions and provide timely support.
5. Offer Targeted Financial Solutions: Analyze the needs and preferences of customers within the age group of 50-70. Provide tailored financial solutions, such as retirement planning, investment options, and specialized services, to meet their unique requirements.
6. Provide Value-added Products and Services: Continuously assess the market to identify emerging trends and offer innovative products and services that differentiate the bank from competitors. Regularly review and update existing offerings to remain competitive.
7. Foster Trust and Transparency: Build trust and transparency through clear communication, fair pricing, and reliable services. Ensure customers feel valued and have confidence in the bank’s integrity and commitment to their financial well-being.
8. Complaint Resolution: Improve the complaint resolution process by actively addressing customer complaints, providing prompt and satisfactory solutions, and enhancing customer support channels. This can help reduce churn rates associated with unresolved complaints.

Conclusion:

By implementing these recommendations, the bank can strengthen customer relationships, increase customer satisfaction, and ultimately reduce churn rates. Regular monitoring and analysis of customer behavior and feedback will help refine strategies and further improve customer retention efforts.
